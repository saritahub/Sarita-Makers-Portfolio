# 2. I'm equipped for long term growth

## Goal 1: I manage my own wellbeing
### Reflect: What does it mean to manage my own wellbeing?

Software engineering requires sustained learning, and we are required to solve new problems every day. With this in mind, it is essential to manage our mental and physical wellbeing. 

## Mental wellbeing
- Daily meditation for at least 10 minutes. This includes: 
  - [Balance](https://www.balanceapp.com/) meditation app (over 400 day streak 🔥) 🧘🏽‍♀️
  - Participated in Dana's daily meditation at Makers
  - Reflecting on meditations in a _non-judugemental_ manner
  - Journalling
  - Taking regular breaks
  - Planning my week ahead, allowing time for reflection and relaxation 
  - Meal prepping (**Seriously!** Not having the mental load of "What's for dinner tonight?!" really allows me to concentrate my focus. And this in turn helps my physical well-being)


## Physicial wellbeing
- Daily exercise. Includes a variety of workouts to keep things interesting, including:
  - Yoga 🧘🏽‍♀️
  - Hiking 🚶🏽‍♀️
  - Gym 🏋🏽‍♀️
  - Spin cycle classes 🚴🏽‍♀️
  - Pilates 🙆🏽‍♀️

- Stretch every day, focusing on areas that are impacted by desk work. 🙆🏽‍♀️


#### Goal 2: I can learn anything by myself
- Actively challenging a growth mindset 🧠
- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) 
  - This course has massively shaped how I view learning. There is no 'one' method that can help you learn, it is about finding the right mixture that works for you. And importantly, being flexible to try new approaches.
